# Log:  
*  _NB: All subclass labels in the .csv files are given in the last column._  
*  _NB: All subclassing Jupyter notebooks show the 128 x 128 image patches along with their  
assigned subclass label._
*  2022_10_29_01_44_40_upload Jupyter notebook with all 64 MFs on slide 2 subclassed  
along with .csv of final output df  
    *  ___NB: The first 64 rows in the .csv contain the agreed-upon subclass labels for  
    all MFs in slide 2; the remaining rows contain an arbitrary 'label' of '9' which just means  
    that none of these patches were subclassed in the accompanying Jupyter notebook.___
*  2022_10_29_22_35_47_uploaded Jupyter notebook with 32 MLFs on slide 2 subclassed  
along with .csv of final output df   
    *  ___NB: The first 34 rows in the .csv contain 32 MLF annotations (label '8') and 2 'ignore'  
    labels ('0', for not being ambiguous examples). All remaining rows contain the arbitrary 'label'  
    '42' in the last (subclass label) column, indicating that none of these were subclassed in the  
    accompanying Jupyter notebook.___
