# Log:  
*  _NB: All subclass labels in the .csv files are given in the last column._  
*  _NB: All subclassing Jupyter notebooks show 128 x 128 image patches of all annotations  
   that were subclassed in the notebook; assigned subclass labels are shown for confirmation  
   just below the displayed image patches._  
*  2022_10_29_01_44_40_uploaded Jupyter notebook with all 64 MFs on slide 2 subclassed  
along with .csv of final output df  
    *  ___NB: The first 64 rows in the .csv contain the agreed-upon subclass labels for  
    all MFs in slide 2; the remaining rows contain an arbitrary 'label' of '9' which just means  
    that none of these patches were subclassed in this notebook.___
*  2022_10_29_22_35_47_uploaded Jupyter notebook with 32 MLFs on slide 2 subclassed  
along with .csv of final output df   
    *  ___NB: The first 34 rows in the .csv contain 32 MLF annotations (label '8') and 2 'ignore'  
    labels ('0', considered ambiguous examples). All remaining rows contain the arbitrary 'label'  
    '42' in the last column, indicating that none of these were subclassed in this notebook.___
