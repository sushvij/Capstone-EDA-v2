# Capstone-EDA-v2
Given the dataset is too large for a free github repository, this repository currently contains our Exploratory Data Analysis.
Please see the outputs within the jupyter notebooks.
Start with databaseStatistics.ipynb in the main directory for a high level understanding of the data. And, then move into the various .ipynb_checkpoints that conduct further analysis.
Note running any cell will not work as the dataset is stored locally elsewhere.
