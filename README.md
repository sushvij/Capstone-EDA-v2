# Capstone-EDA-v2
This repository currently contains our Exploratory Data Analysis. And, branches will be created to add more outputs as they are developed.
Given the dataset is too large for a free github repository, this repository currently focuses on jupyter notebooks with outputs.
Please see the outputs within the jupyter notebooks.
Start with databaseStatistics.ipynb in the main directory for a high level understanding of the data. And, then for a deeper dive into a particular sample, look at the Google colab notebook maub_eda_v2_present_xcc_fsl.ipynb.
Note running any cell will not work as the dataset has to be stored locally elsewhere.
